# Overview and Goals

* This paper sets out to optimize the cost of producing a water supply that meets and exceeds the water quality requirements for agriculutural reuse.
* Explores 11 "treatment trains." 
* Proposes an optimized blending ratio of wastewater for each treatment train for turfgrass and citrus.

# Treatment Trains

* For each "train" they found the optimal blending of wastewater.
* They did this for both turfgrass and citrus.

# Regional Water Reuse Decision-Support Model

* Inputs:      
    * Concentrations of water quality parameters in a given unit volume of wastewater.    
    * Concentrations of water quality parameters associated with effluent from each treatment process.    
    * Concentration limits of water quality parameters to meet crop requirements.     
    * The unit cost for each treatment process.

* Constraints:      
    * Blending ratio equal to 1: $\sum_{j=1}^{J_T} b_t(J) = 1$     
    * Final ratio of constituents resulting from blending must be less than that of the crop's guidelines: $\sum_{j=1}^{J_T} p_T(i,j) \cdot b_T(j) \leq a(i)$

```

* MF-RO treatment train results for turfgrass, under all three scenarios
* They produced $11\times 2 \times 6$ of these, total 132 ratios

# Results (broader)

## Citrus

* The treatment costs for large facilities were nearly 50% less than the costs under smallâˆ’medium plant sizes, highlighting the effect of economies of scale.
* They were able to generate a feasible and cost-effective irrigation source for citrus while complying with Title 22 regulations and without affecting soil and crop health.

## Turfgrass

* Chlorine disinfection was necessary to ensure that the water quality was compliant with Title 22 regulations.
* Economies of scale still applies.

# Limitations

* Water quality requirements associated with two separate crops in isolation 
* Cost-minimization framework. The alternative here is that cropwater production functions could be incorporated into the model along with their associated prices and costs so that the model could identify efficient solutions in which net benefits are maximized; net benefits are defined by the profits to the water user less the costs to the wastewater treatment plant operator.
